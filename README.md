# WeatherAppV2

Made with React.JS and bootstrap


I created this app as a customisation of a weather app tutorial I found online. The original app took and city name and country as a text input and displayed the current weather using the Weather API - https://openweathermap.org

This version instead of using a text input field uses 3 buttoms to display the current weather at Belfast, Lurgan and Liverpool
